# mrsh-v2

This is a git mirror/fork of [Frank Breitinger](https://www.fbreitinger.de/?page_id=218)'s reference implementation of [mrsh-v2](https://digitalcommons.newhaven.edu/electricalcomputerengineering-facpubs/67/).

I am not the original author, but I have made some additions and fixes under the terms of the original license.

## To build:
Clone this repository and run `make`. If that works, run `./mrsh-v2 -h` for usage information.
